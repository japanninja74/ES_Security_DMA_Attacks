\chapter{Structure of the work} \label{CH_struct}

This document aims to be a collection of all the material we got and developed for the project of \textit{Operating Systems for Embedded Systems}. 

The request was to collect the material in a way that is easily accessible by a student who is studying this topic. From our point of view, the most useful thing to do was to mix some explanations with other external resources. In this way, we can ensure to provide the correct information before introducing the material we have used. 

This document has the following structure:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \autoref{CH_intro} is a simple introduction to Direct Access Memory (DMA) attacks. This type of attack is not particularly difficult to understand, as the interesting part is to perform (and try to avoid) it, so that is only a small part of the work;
    \item \autoref{CH_doc} explains the two libraries we wrote for the LPC1768 microprocessor, to activate and use the UART peripheral and the GPDMA controller;
    \item \autoref{CH_lit} presents brief overviews of some of the relevant papers that we have identified on this topic.
\end{itemize}
