## DMA attack

The project aims to be a laboratory session to understand what a DMA attack is, both in a theoretical point of view and in practical terms. 

To understand the project, we suggest to read the pdfs inside the folder [DOCUMENTS](https://github.com/pcineverdies/OS4ES-Project/tree/main/DOCUMENTS).
